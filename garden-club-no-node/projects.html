Some people can’t handle success, I can. The key is to enjoy life, because they don’t want you to enjoy life. I promise you, they don’t want you to jetski, they don’t want you to smile. We don’t see them, we will never see them. I’m up to something. It’s on you how you want to live your life. Everyone has a choice. I pick my choice, squeaky clean. Another one. It’s on you how you want to live your life. Everyone has a choice. I pick my choice, squeaky clean. Life is what you make it, so let’s make it. Give thanks to the most high. The key to more success is to get a massage once a week, very important, major key, cloth talk. You see the hedges, how I got it shaped up? It’s important to shape up your hedges, it’s like getting a haircut, stay fresh. Learning is cool, but knowing is better, and I know the key to success.</p>
